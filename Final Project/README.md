### I. Project Overview
<p align="justify"> SwiftRent is a vehicle rental management system implemented using the Python language as a basis for the implementation of Object-Oriented Product (OOP) for the construction of a rational, expandable, and sustainable computer enterprise. The system enables customers to only to hire vehicles, monitor bookings and transactions with charges while the back-end enables administrators to monitor the vehicles, and particularly manage the transactions from the clients. A customer can view available cars select the car they want and book it, update it and even cancel it with the system automatically calculating the rental duration and charges. Admins have the ability to add, update, or remove vehicles from the system and monitor vehicle availability. It also incorporates with a database like MySQL or SQLite to keep track of users’ information, vehicles’ information, rentals and payment as well as history to provide persistence. SwiftRent effectively handles all aspects of vehicle rental management, offering a seamless experience for both customers and administrators while maintaining a robust and secure backend.

### III. The chosen SDG and its integration into the project.
<p align="justify"> By tackling the issues of fast urbanization, **SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities** seeks to create inclusive, secure, resilient, and sustainable cities. Given that over half of the world's population resides in cities, this aim focuses on developing urban environments that minimize the environmental impact of cities while promoting universal access to affordable housing, effective public transportation, and basic services. Enhancing public areas, increasing catastrophe resilience, lowering urban pollution, and guaranteeing access to sustainable and safe transportation are important goals. Along with advocating for integrated urban design that promotes inclusivity, climate resilience, and resource efficiency, SDG 11 also promotes the preservation of cultural and natural heritage. The objective is to create cities that offer a good standard of living, are safe and accessible for all people, irrespective of their socioeconomic status, and are environmentally sustainable by 2030.

<p align="justify"> Access to safe, reasonably priced, and ecologically friendly urban transportation systems is one of SDG 11's main goals, and a vehicle rental system can be extremely helpful in reaching this goal. A vehicle rental system encourages electric vehicles and shared mobility, which lessens the demand for individual automobile ownership. This makes cities more sustainable by reducing carbon emissions, air pollution, and traffic congestion. This is in line with SDG 11's objective of lessening cities' environmental impact. Furthermore, by providing reasonably priced transportation options for people who might not be able to purchase a private vehicle, such a system might encourage inclusive urbanization by guaranteeing that all locals have access to dependable and safe transportation. The system's integration of electric vehicles also lessens the need for fossil fuels, which improves air quality and aids in cities' transition to more climate-resilient urban infrastructure. By encouraging people to use sustainable options like public transportation, shared bikes, or electric vehicles, a vehicle rental system that integrates with public transportation networks also supports the development of a multi-modal transportation system, further reducing emissions and improving the accessibility and efficiency of urban transportation. In this sense, a car rental service directly contributes to a number of SDG 11 goals, enhancing the quality of life for city dwellers and fostering more inclusive, resilient, and sustainable cities.

### IV. Installation
&nbsp; __Instructions for running the program__
<br/><br/>
- __Step 1: Install Python and Required Libraries__
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <p align="justify">  Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your computer. If not, download and install it from     python.org. 
    &nbsp; Additionally, this script uses SQLite3, which comes pre-installed with Python, so no additional installation is required.
- __Step 2: Save the Script__
  <p align="justify"> &nbsp; 1.	Open a text editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, or even Notepad).
  <p align="justify"> &nbsp; 2.	Copy the entire Python code you provided.
  <p align="justify"> &nbsp; 3.	Paste the code into the editor.
  <p align="justify"> &nbsp; 4.	Save the file as vehicle_rental.py.
- __Step 3: Prepare Your Working Directory__
  <p align="justify"> Ensure you are working in a directory where you have permission to create and delete files (because the script will create a SQLite database file).
- __Step 4: Run the Script__
  <p align="justify"> &nbsp; 1.	Open your command prompt/terminal.
  <p align="justify"> &nbsp; 2.	Navigate to the folder where vehicle_rental.py is saved. You can use the cd command to change directories. Example:
